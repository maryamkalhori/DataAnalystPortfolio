The dashboard is designed to analyze and visualize factors impacting airline passenger satisfaction. 

It utilizes a Kaggle dataset containing passenger characteristics, flight details, and ratings of various travel aspects. 

The dashboard comprises four sections:

__Passengers Characteristics__: This section provides an overview of passenger attributes such as customer loyalty, travel type (personal or business), age group, gender, and travel distance. It also displays the distribution of satisfaction levels (satisfied or dissatisfied) across these groups. Filters are available to select specific groups and observe satisfaction level differences.

__Factors Influencing Satisfaction__: This section compares average ratings for various factors affecting satisfaction, including online booking, check-in service, inflight service, seat comfort, cleanliness, etc. Slicers enable selection of desired groups for rating analysis. Additionally, a bar chart visually represents the correlation between each factor and satisfaction level, revealing the impact of each factor.

__Dissatisfaction Analysis__: This section offers a detailed examination of factors leading to passenger dissatisfaction. Filters can be utilized to explore specific groups and identify main issues causing dissatisfaction.
