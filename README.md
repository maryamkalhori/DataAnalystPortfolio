## About
Hi, I'm Maryam! I have a technical background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Industerial management and Bachelor degree in Mathematics. I have over 6 years of experience in the field of data analysis, where I held roles such as Data analyst, business intelligence analyst and data scientist and I am always eager to learn new tools and techniques to enhance my data skills.\
I have gained extensive experience in utilizing Python libraries including pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for various tasks such as data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Additionally, I have a strong command of SQL, enabling me to efficiently query, join, and aggregate data from diverse sources such as relational databases.\
I am adept at creating interactive and insightful dashboards and reports using Power BI. Furthermore, I have successfully utilized data modeling techniques such as regression, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection to solve complex business problems and generate valuable insights.
